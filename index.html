            <h2>Up to Date CDC Recommendations</h2>
            <p>
                Updated information for fully vaccinated people given new evidence on the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant currently circulating in the United States.
                Added a recommendation for fully vaccinated people to wear a mask in public indoor settings in areas of substantial or high transmission.
                Added information that fully vaccinated people might choose to wear a mask regardless of the level of transmission, particularly if they are immunocompromised or at increased risk for severe disease from COVID-19, or if they have someone in their household who is immunocompromised, at increased risk of severe disease or not fully vaccinated.
                Added a recommendation for fully vaccinated people who have come into close contact with someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 to be tested 3-5 days after exposure, and to wear a mask in public indoor settings for 14 days or until they receive a negative test result.
                CDC recommends universal indoor masking for all teachers, staff, students, and visitors to schools, regardless of vaccination status.
